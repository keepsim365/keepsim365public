## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

This document presents the strategy for migrating the **Business Control Dashboard (BCD)** from the shared Universal BCD Stack in the current TC-15 account into its own dedicated AWS account. It follows the same migration pattern established by the Personalization in IVR workload, which demonstrated a successful, low-risk approach to isolating loosely coupled platform services into separate AWS accounts.

### 1.2 Background

The BCD is a critical internal tool used by business operations teams to manage queue configurations, routing decisions, and real-time operational controls for the contact centre. Today, all BCD components — including the Micro Front End, Queue Control service, Decision Engine, and associated DynamoDB tables — run within the **Universal BCD Stack** inside the shared **TC-15** AWS account.

While this shared model simplified initial deployment, it introduces several challenges as the platform scales:

- **Blast radius risk**: A misconfiguration or failed deployment in BCD can impact other services in TC-15 (IVR, Chat, etc.)
- **IAM over-permissioning**: BCD resources share IAM boundaries with unrelated workloads
- **Cost obscurity**: BCD operational costs are commingled with other TC-15 workloads
- **Deployment coupling**: BCD release cycles are constrained by shared CI/CD pipelines and Lambda concurrency limits

### 1.3 Scope

This strategy covers:

- Current state architecture of BCD within TC-15
- Proposed target design with BCD in a dedicated AWS account
- Comprehensive considerations and benefits analysis
- Migration approach and phasing
- Alignment with the broader multi-account strategy

---

## 2. Current State Architecture

### 2.1 Architecture Overview

The BCD currently operates as part of the **Universal BCD Stack** within the **TC-15 AWS account**. The architecture consists of the following key components:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    TC-15 AWS Account                         │

│                          ▼                                    │
│                   ┌──────────────┐                            │
│                   │  CX Session  │                            │
│                   │    Store     │                            │
│                   │ (DynamoDB)   │                            │
│                   └──────────────┘                            │
│                                                              │
│  Also in TC-15: IVR Core, Chat, SNS Topics, Connect,        │
│  Personalization*, other Lambda functions                     │
│  (* Personalization now migrated to own account)             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2.2 Component Inventory

| Component | Service Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Micro Front End** | S3 + CloudFront | React-based dashboard UI for business users |
| **Queue Control** | Lambda | Manages queue configurations and routing rules |
| **Decision Engine** | Lambda | Executes business routing logic and decision trees |
| **CX Session Store** | DynamoDB | Stores session data and operational state |
| **Transfer to Queue** | SQS/Lambda | Manages queue transfer operations |
| **API Gateway** | API Gateway | Exposes BCD APIs for front-end consumption |

### 2.3 Integration Points

The BCD has the following integration points with other TC-15 services:

1. **AWS Connect** — The Decision Engine feeds routing decisions back to Connect contact flows
2. **SNS Topics** — BCD subscribes to event notifications for real-time updates
3. **IVR Core Lambdas** — Some shared Lambda layers and environment configurations
4. **CloudWatch** — Shared monitoring and logging within TC-15 account
5. **IAM Roles** — Shared IAM boundary with all TC-15 workloads

### 2.4 Current Challenges

| Challenge | Impact | Severity |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Shared blast radius with IVR core | A BCD deployment failure can affect live customer calls | 🔴 High |
| Commingled IAM permissions | BCD Lambdas have broader permissions than necessary | 🟠 Medium |
| No independent cost tracking | Cannot determine true BCD operational cost | 🟠 Medium |
| Shared Lambda concurrency | BCD and IVR compete for Lambda concurrent executions | 🔴 High |
| Coupled deployment pipeline | BCD releases are constrained by TC-15 change windows | 🟡 Low |
| Shared DynamoDB capacity | CX Session Store competes with other DynamoDB tables | 🟠 Medium |

---

## 3. Target Design

### 3.1 Proposed Architecture

The proposal is to migrate the BCD backend services — **API Gateway, Lambda functions (Queue Control, Decision Engine), and DynamoDB tables (CX Session Store)** — into their own dedicated AWS account, following the same pattern used for Personalization.

### 3.2 What Moves to the New BCD Account

| Component | Migration Action |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **API Gateway** | New API Gateway created in BCD account |
| **BCD API Functions (Lambda)** | Queue Control + Decision Engine Lambdas migrate |
| **CX Session Store (DynamoDB)** | DynamoDB tables replicated/migrated to BCD account |
| **Authorizer (Lambda)** | New authorizer Lambda for cross-account API security |
| **CloudWatch Logs & Metrics** | Dedicated monitoring in the BCD account |

### 3.3 What Stays in TC-15

| Component | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **AWS Connect** | Core contact centre service, must remain in TC-15 |
| **SNS Topics** | Shared event bus used by multiple services |
| **Update Trigger / Fetch Trigger** | Event-driven Lambdas that react to Connect events |
| **Micro Front End** | Can remain in TC-15 initially (or migrate in Phase 2) |
| **Transfer to Queue** | Tightly coupled with Connect routing |

### 3.4 Cross-Account Integration Pattern

Communication between TC-15 and the new BCD account will use **cross-account API calls** with the following security controls:

1. **API Gateway with IAM Authorization** — BCD API Gateway uses IAM-based auth
2. **Cross-Account IAM Roles** — Scoped trust relationships between TC-15 and BCD account
3. **Resource-Based Policies** — Explicit permissions for cross-account access
4. **VPC Peering / PrivateLink** — For private network connectivity (if required)

---

## 4. Considerations and Benefits

### 4.1 Business-Level Benefits

#### 1. Risk Containment → Reduced Business Impact

- Today, a failure, misconfiguration, or security issue in one component can impact the entire IVR/contact-centre stack
- By isolating the **BCD Service** into a separate AWS account:
  - Issues are contained to the BCD service only
  - Core IVR call routing and flows remain unaffected
- **Outcome: Lower probability of customer-impacting outages.** By doing this we are reducing the risk of a single technical issue affecting the live customer calls

#### 2. Improved Availability of Business Operations

- BCD is critical for business operations teams to manage queue configurations in real-time
- With account isolation:
  - BCD can be updated independently without IVR change windows
  - Business users retain control even during IVR maintenance periods
- **Outcome: Higher availability of operational controls.** Business teams are not blocked by IVR deployment schedules

#### 3. Clear Cost Visibility and Accountability

- Separate AWS account = clear cost attribution
- Enables:
  - Exact cost of BCD platform features
  - ROI analysis (Is the BCD worth X£ per month?)
- **Outcome: Better financial governance and decision making**

#### 4. Faster, Safer Change Enablement

- Changes to BCD business logic are frequent and driven by operational needs
- Account isolation enables:
  - Independent deployments
  - Faster experimentation without risk to IVR core
- **Outcome: Faster innovation with controlled risk**

---

### 4.2 Technical and Architectural Benefits

#### 1. Blast Radius Reduction (Primary Driver)

- Failures isolated at:
  - IAM Level
  - Service Quota Level
  - Networking level
  - Deployment level
- Example:
  - Bad Lambda deployment
  - DynamoDB throttling
  - API Gateway misconfiguration
- **Outcome: Does not affect IVR core account**

#### 2. Stronger Security Boundaries (Account = Hard Boundary)

- Accounts are the strongest isolation boundary in AWS
- Security Improvements:
  - No accidental IAM over-permissioning
  - Explicit cross-account IAM roles
  - Scoped trust relationships
  - Separate KMS keys
  - Separate CloudTrail logs
- BCD data access is explicitly isolated and controlled
- **Outcome: Hardened security posture for operational control plane**

#### 3. Clear Service Ownership Model

- BCD becomes a logical platforms service
- Clear Ownership:
  - APIs
  - DynamoDB schema
  - SLAs
- Avoids:
  - Shared Account anti-pattern
  - Accidental coupling over time
- **This moves you toward service-oriented ownership, not shared infra**

#### 4. Independent Scaling and Throttling Controls

- With Isolation:
  - Separate API Gateway throttles
  - Lambda Concurrency
  - DynamoDB capacity
- Prevents:
  - Traffic spikes in BCD affecting IVR Lambdas
- Enables:
  - Fine-grained scaling strategies
- **Outcome: BCD scales independently without competing for shared resources**

---

### 4.3 Operational Benefits

#### 1. Safer Deployments

- CI/CD pipelines are isolated
- A failed deployment in BCD:
  - Cannot break IVR routing
  - Cannot exhaust shared Lambda concurrency
- Enables:
  - Blue/Green releases independently

#### 2. Improved Incident Response

- During Incidents:
  - Smaller scope to investigate
  - Clear ownership
  - Clear CloudWatch metrics per account
- **Outcome: Faster mean time to resolution (MTTR)**

#### 3. Compliance and Audit Readiness

- BCD operational data access can be:
  - Logged independently
  - Reviewed independently
- Easier to demonstrate:
  - Least privilege
  - Data isolation
  - Access boundaries
- **Outcome: Simplified audit trail for operational controls**

#### 4. Avoid Account-Level Resource Bottlenecks

- Independent quota pools per account
- By moving BCD into its own account:
  - It gets its own set of AWS service quotas
- No competition with:
  - IVR core Lambdas
  - Chat Services
  - Other Backend workloads
- **Prevents one service exhausting shared limits**

---

### 4.4 Future-Proofing and Strategic Benefits

#### 1. Foundation for Multi-Account Strategy

- This move is low risk and high learning and an ideal choice for start-up on multi-Account strategy being covered in the parent page
- It sets pattern for:
  - Other loosely coupled services to be moved if required
  - Analytics
  - Reporting
- **This is the second step (after Personalization), not a one-off exception**

#### 2. Easier Platform Evolution

- If Later:
  - BCD logic changes
  - DynamoDB → EDP (Enterprise Data Platform)
- Isolation ensures:
  - Minimum ripple effect
  - Contract-based integration (API)

#### 3. BCD as a Reusable Platform Service

- BCD capability can grow independently
- The organization can:
  - Enhance operational controls faster
  - Experiment with new decision logic much easily
  - Add intelligence (ML-driven routing) without risking call stability
- It can be reused by:
  - IVR
  - Chat
  - Outbound Campaigns
  - Video and other future channels
- IVR becomes one of many consumers and not the only one
- Centralized operational intelligence
- Consistent business control across channels
- **Shared intelligence instead of duplicated logic which reduces overall system complexity, not increases it**

#### 4. Alignment with Generative AI Strategy

- A dedicated BCD account positions the platform to:
  - Integrate with AI-powered decision engines
  - Leverage Bedrock/SageMaker for intelligent routing
  - Implement ML-based queue optimization
- **Outcome: Future-ready architecture for AI-enhanced operations**

---

## 5. Migration Approach

### 5.1 Phased Migration Plan

Following the same proven approach used for Personalization, the BCD migration will be executed in controlled phases:

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1–2)

| Activity | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Provision new BCD AWS account | Via AWS Organizations, apply SCPs |
| Set up networking | VPC, subnets, security groups, VPC peering/PrivateLink to TC-15 |
| Configure IAM | Cross-account roles, trust policies, KMS keys |
| Set up CI/CD pipeline | Independent deployment pipeline for BCD account |
| Configure CloudWatch | Dedicated dashboards, alarms, log groups |

#### Phase 2: Build & Test (Weeks 3–4)

| Activity | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Deploy API Gateway | New BCD API Gateway with IAM authorizer |
| Deploy Lambda functions | Queue Control, Decision Engine, Authorizer |
| Create DynamoDB tables | CX Session Store with matching schema |
| Data migration strategy | DynamoDB Streams for initial sync |
| Integration testing | Verify cross-account API calls from TC-15 |

#### Phase 3: Cutover (Weeks 5–6)

| Activity | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Shadow traffic routing | Route a percentage of traffic to new account |
| Validation period | Monitor for errors, latency, data consistency |
| Full cutover | Switch all traffic to new BCD account |
| Decommission old resources | Remove old Lambdas and DynamoDB tables from TC-15 |
| Documentation update | Update runbooks, architecture diagrams |

### 5.2 Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Cross-account latency | Use PrivateLink for low-latency private connectivity |
| Data consistency during migration | DynamoDB Streams for real-time replication |
| Rollback capability | Keep TC-15 resources running in parallel during cutover |
| Business disruption | Execute cutover during low-traffic maintenance window |
| Monitoring gaps | Pre-configure CloudWatch dashboards before cutover |

### 5.3 Success Criteria

- [ ] All BCD API calls successfully routed through new account
- [ ] Zero impact to IVR core call routing during migration
- [ ] DynamoDB data consistency validated (100% match)
- [ ] Independent deployment pipeline operational
- [ ] CloudWatch monitoring operational with alerting
- [ ] Cross-account API latency < 50ms p99
- [ ] Business operations team confirms full functionality

## 6. Lessons Learned from Personalization Migration

The Personalization workload was the first service migrated to its own account and provides valuable lessons for BCD:

| Lesson | Application to BCD |
|--------|-------------------|
| Cross-account IAM role setup requires careful scoping | Pre-define all trust policies and test in non-prod first |
| DynamoDB migration needs careful planning | Use DynamoDB Streams for zero-downtime data sync |
| Monitoring must be set up before cutover | Deploy CloudWatch dashboards in Phase 1 |
| Rollback plan is essential | Maintain TC-15 resources for 2 weeks post-cutover |
| Business stakeholder communication is key | Brief business operations team on cutover timeline |

---

## 7. Alignment with Multi-Account Strategy

This BCD migration directly supports the broader multi-account strategy outlined in the parent document:

| Strategic Goal | BCD Migration Contribution |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Pattern 5 (Major Workload Separation) | BCD becomes an independently managed workload |
| Blast radius reduction | BCD failures isolated from IVR core |
| Service ownership model | Clear ownership of BCD APIs, data, and SLAs |
| Cost attribution | Dedicated AWS account enables precise cost tracking |
| Foundation for further migrations | Validates the migration pattern for subsequent services |
